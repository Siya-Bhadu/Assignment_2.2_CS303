# Assignment 2 - CS303 (Data Structures)
## Question 2 - Stacks
## Description
The following program allows you to check and manipulate a stack using vectors in C++. This allows for user inputs when you create the stack. 

This stack has the following features:

- Creates a stack object: Initializes an empty stack.
- Checks if the stack is empty (empty).
- Inserts integer values onto the top of the stack (push).
- Removes and returns the top element element of the stack (pop).
- Accesses the top element of the stack and returns the element without removing it (top).
- Finds the average value of the stack elements by computing and returning the mean of all elements in the stack (average).

## Files
- Assignment_2.2_CS303.cpp - Main program with all function implementations.
- Assignment_2.2_CS303.h - Header file containing file declarations.

## How to Run + Functionality
1. Open the project in your C++ IDE (Visual Studio)
2. Make sure you are in the correct project directory, containing Assignment_2.2_CS303.cpp and Assignment_2.2_CS303.h.
3. Build and run the program.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and the expected output order is:
   - When the user compiles the program, it will call and check to see if the stack is empty. It will return "Yes" or "No."
   - The user will be asked to input five numbers to add to the stack.
   - Once the user has inputted five numbers, it will have pushed the values to the stack and will display the stack in its entirety.
   - Next, the program will pop the top value off the stack and display the updated stack.
   - Then, it will print the value on the top of the stack.
   - Finally, the program will find and print the average of the integers that are found in the stack.
